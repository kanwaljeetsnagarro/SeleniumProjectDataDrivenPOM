### 1. What does this edit mode do?
This edit mode allows you to make modifications to specific files provided by the user. It ensures that changes are grouped by file, with concise code blocks showing only the necessary updates. Unchanged code is represented with comments (`...existing code...`) to avoid repetition. Each code block starts with a comment containing the filepath for clarity. This mode is designed to help users integrate changes efficiently into their existing files.

### 2. Change the file to include the url - amazon.com
Update the `BASE_URL` to include "https://www.amazon.com" in `BasePage.java`.

---

### 3. Run the tests
The tests have been executed successfully! Here's a summary of the results:
- All 14 test cases passed with no failures or errors
- Tests included various login scenarios (standard user, invalid password, locked out user, etc.)
- The build was successful and all test validations passed as expected.

### 4. Prompts to create a framework from scratch
A sequence of prompts to create a Selenium POM framework:
1. Project Structure Setup
2. Dependencies Setup
3. Base Classes Setup
4. Utilities Setup
5. Configuration Setup
6. Page Objects Setup
7. Test Cases Setup

Best practices and incremental setup prompts are also provided for maintainability and extensibility.

### 5. Explain the framework as you would to a newbie in selenium
- **BaseTest**: Handles test setup/teardown (browser management).
- **BasePage**: Handles common web page actions (click, type, wait, etc.).
- **Page Classes**: Represent each web page, inherit from BasePage.
- **Test Classes**: Inherit from BaseTest, use page classes to run tests.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Uses Excel files for test data.
- **Benefits**: Reusability, maintainability, readability, and organization.

---

### 6. The flow and use of driver object
- **BaseTest** creates the WebDriver (browser) and makes it available to all test classes that extend BaseTest (like LoginTest).
- Test classes use this driver to create page objects (e.g., LoginPage).
- Page objects pass the driver to BasePage via the constructor.
- BasePage uses this driver for all browser actions.
- After each test, BaseTest closes the browser.

---

### 7. Still not able to understand the flow of driver and have not usually seen the base page and base test classes separately
- **BaseTest**: Manages browser lifecycle.
- **BasePage**: Provides reusable web actions.
- **Page classes**: Represent each web page, inherit from BasePage.
- **Test classes**: Inherit from BaseTest, use page classes to run tests.
- Analogy: BaseTest = "How to start/stop the car"; BasePage = "How to drive the car".

---

### 8. I believe the flow of driver is from base test to login test, which gives it to the login page and the login page calls super constructor with the same driver using which the base page is initializing its driver variable and that driver is used in methods? Is this correct??
Yes, your understanding is correct! The same driver instance flows from BaseTest → LoginTest → LoginPage → BasePage, and is used for all browser actions in your test.

---

### 9. Why this complexity? Can we not have a single base class and a simple driver flow?
- **Separation of Concerns**: BaseTest is for test setup/teardown; BasePage is for web page actions.
- **Cleaner Code**: Test classes shouldn’t have all the page interaction logic.
- **Reusability & Maintainability**: All page classes inherit common actions from BasePage, using the same driver.
- This structure is a best practice for scalable, professional test automation.

---

### 10. Is there a name for this kind of a design pattern in POM?
Yes, this approach is commonly called the "Base Page Object Pattern" or simply "Base Page Pattern" within the Page Object Model (POM) design.
